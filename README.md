# Sampling in Python: Air Quality Data Exploration

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for exploring sampling techniques in Python, specifically applied to an air quality dataset focused on carbon monoxide levels. Effective sampling is a key skill for data professionals working with large datasets, as it allows for meaningful analysis without the need to process every data point.

## Objective

As part of an analytics team for the **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**, your task is to analyze air quality data related to carbon monoxide â€” a significant air pollutant. The dataset covers over **200 monitoring sites**, each uniquely identified by:

- State Name
- County Name
- City Name
- Local Site Name

Through this activity, you will practice various sampling methods to efficiently reduce the dataset size while maintaining its representativeness for meaningful analysis.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understand the importance of sampling in data analysis.
- Apply different Python-based sampling techniques to large datasets.
- Explore how sampling improves analysis efficiency and accuracy.
- Prepare sampled data for further statistical analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Dataset Description

The air quality dataset contains detailed information on carbon monoxide levels collected across multiple locations in the United States. Each record provides:

- Geographical identifiers (State, County, City, Site)
- Air quality measurements
- Relevant timestamps
